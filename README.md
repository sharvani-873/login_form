ðŸ“˜ Project Description

The Student Login and Management System is a web-based application developed to simplify and automate the process of handling student data in an educational institution. It offers a secure login system for authorized users and a user-friendly dashboard to manage student records.

Once logged in, users can:
- Add new student details,
- View the complete student list,
- Edit student information,
- Delete student records when necessary.

This project is ideal for learning full-stack web development using PHP and MySQL, and it demonstrates how to build a dynamic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system. Whether you're a beginner exploring PHP or an institution needing a simple student database, this project is a practical and scalable solution.
